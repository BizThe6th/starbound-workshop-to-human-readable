# Starbound - Workshop to Human-Readable
Pulls the name for your starbound mods from their steam workshop pages' HTML to make your mods more readable for an
external copy, or server.

Installations are to the right of this page, and there is a README.txt with usage info there.

This program was written in java, but comes bundled with a version of OpenJDK v21 so you don't need to intall anything else *Other than a steam copy of starbound, of course.*
