## What is this?

Biz's _"Workshop to Human Readable for Starbound"_ pulls the name for your starbound mods from their steam workshop pages'
HTML to make your mods more readable for an
external copy, or server.

## Instructions:

Installations are to the right of this page, and there is a "<code>README.txt</code>" with usage info in there.

This program was written in java, but comes bundled with a version of OpenJDK v21 *so you don't need to intall anything
else* **Other than a steam copy of starbound, of course.**
